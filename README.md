# CMP105 2024-5 

Forbidden Rhythms. 
by William Kavanagh.

A mixed style game with the following 3 levels:
1. A simple rhythm-movement game where a lecturer offers helpful tips.
2. A dino jump level.
3. A complicated rhythm-movement game where a lecturer keeps changing things up.

Note: This is not polished, or bug-free. But it (mostly) works. There are thousands of ways in which it can be improved/extended/expanded/remade/rebuilt.

This is an optional project to be extended by CMP105 students for the individual submission starting in week 9.
